	<h1> Evaluation Notes </h1>

	<p> When I submitted my structure of the site, my instructor told me to improve the details about the site and<br>
		add more components to the structure chart and all.My subtopics were not properly clear. There were not enough <br>
		subtopics as well. The description of the wireframes were not clear and many components and functions were missing. <br>
