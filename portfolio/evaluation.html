	<b>The information given in the site wasnot so much appropriate because it contained limited informations where there were so limited use of site structures. When I first submitted the draft, it was according to the site informations only. I didnot let my extra infromation on that draft but later when my tutor told me to improvise the site structure with your extra knowledge, I did use lots of extra techniques. The final outcome was good to see as a user.</b>
